  * Mipmap type - Nearest, Linear

* **Anisotropic Filtering** ([examples](http://imgur.com/a/rtZBx#0))
  * Restores details in mipmapped textures
  * AF level - OFF, 2, 4, 8, 16 (depends on hardware support)

* **Faster Math**: Uses smaller lookup table which fits better in the L1 CPU cache

* **FPS control**
  * Smooth FPS - stabilizes FPS by flushing the graphics driver buffers ([examples)](http://imgur.com/a/QsOdl#0)
  * Smooth Input - fixes stuck keys, slow input and sound lag by setting correct thread priorities

* **Chunk Loading Control**
  * Load Far - loads the world chunks at distance
  * Far, allows fast render distance switching
  * Preloaded Chunks - defines an area in which no new chunks will be loaded
  * Chunk Updates per Frame - allows for faster world loading
  * Dynamic Updates - loads more chunks per frame when the player is standing still

* **Fast Texturepack Switching**: Switch the current Texturepack without leaving the world
