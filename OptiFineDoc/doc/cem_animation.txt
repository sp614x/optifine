# Custom Entity Model Animations
# Reference configuration for OptiFine's feature Custom Entity Models
######################################################################
# Each model variable which is to be animated is assigned an expression. 
# The expression is evaluated every time the model is rendered and its value is assigned to the variable.
# The variables and expressions are defined in the "animation" section of the json entity model (JEM).
#  
#  "animations":
#  [
#    {
#      "variable1": "expression1",    
#      "variable2": "expression2,
#      ...
#    }
#  ]
# 
# 
# Variables
#
# Model variables are specified in the format 
#   "<model>.<variable_name>"
#
# The model can be:
#  "this" - current custom model
#  "part" - the original part model to which the custom model is attached
#  "<part>" - original model by part name  
#  "<id>" - custom model by ID
#  "<part>:<sub_id>:<sub_sub_id>:..." - (hierarchical) start with original model by part name, then find children by ID
#  "<id>:<sub_id>:<sub_sub_id>:..." - (hierarchical) start with model by ID, then find children by ID
#
# The first model found by part name or ID is used if there are duplicates.
# The model search by ID is deep, also when used in a hierarchical specification. 
#
# The hierarchical specification allows model groups (json part models) to be reused for different parts. 
# For example one hand model ("shoulder:upper_arm:elbow:forearm:palm:finger[1.5]" can be used for both left and right hand.
# The animation can use "left_hand:finger1" for the left thumb and "right_hand:finger1" for the right thumb. 
# The intermediate parents in the hierarchical specification can be skipped. 
#
# Variable names
#   tx, ty, tz    - Translation x, y, z
#   rx, ry, rz    - Rotation x, y, z
#   sx, sy, sz    - Scale x, y, z
#   visible       - Show model and submodels (boolean)
#   visible_boxes - Show model only, does not affect submodels (boolean)
#
# Entity variables
#
# Entity variables are specified in the format "var.<name>" (float) or "varb.<name>" (boolean) 
# The name can be any string, for example "var.xyz", "var.last_rx", etc.
# The variable is attached to the rendered entity and has a default value 0 or false.
# Entity variables are useful for storing animation data between frames.
# Not supported for block entities.
#
# Render variables
#   render.shadow_size                                                  - The size of the shadow underneath an entity
#   render.shadow_opacity                                               - How transparent the shadow is
#   render.shadow_offset_x, render.shadow_offset_z                      - The location of the shadow
#   render.leash_offset_x, render.leash_offset_y, render.leash_offset_z - The position of the point the leash attaches to
#
