# Custom Entity Model Animations
# Reference configuration for OptiFine's feature Custom Entity Models
######################################################################
# Each model variable which is to be animated is assigned an expression. 
# The expression is evaluated every time the model is rendered and its value is assigned to the variable.
# The variables and expressions are defined in the "animation" section of the json entity model (JEM).
#  
#  "animations":
#  [
#    {
#      "variable1": "expression1",    
#      "variable2": "expression2,
#      ...
#    }
#  ]
# 
# 
# Variables
# Model variables are specified in the format 
#   "<model>.<variable_name>"
#
# The model can be:
#  "this" - current custom model
#  "part" - the original part model to which the custom model is attached
#  "<part>" - original model by part name  
#  "<id>" - custom model by ID  
#  "<part>:<sub_id>:<sub_sub_id>:..." - (hierarchical) start with original model by part name, then find children by ID
#  "<id>:<sub_id>:<sub_sub_id>:..." - (hierarchical) start with model by ID, then find children by ID
#
# The first model found by part name or ID is used if there are duplicates.
# The model search by ID is deep, also when used in a hierarchical specification. 
#
# The hierarchical specification allows model groups (json part models) to be reused for different parts. 
# For example one hand model ("shoulder:upper_arm:elbow:forearm:palm:finger[1.5]" can be used for both left and right hand.
# The animation can use "left_hand:finger1" for the left thumb and "right_hand:finger1" for the right thumb. 
# The intermediate parents in the hierarchical specification can be skipped. 
#
# Variable names
#   tx, ty, tz - translation x, y, z
#   rx, ry, rz - rotation x, y, z
#   ox, oy, oz - offset x, y, z (can be used for small translation animations)
# 
# Expressions
#
# Expressions are general mathematical expressions with brackets, constants, variables, operators and functions.
#
# Constants
#   floating point number
#   pi - 3.1415926
#
# Variables
#   <model>.<var> - model variable, see the model variable specification
#   time - current world time in ticks
#
# Render variables (living entity)
#   limb_swing - limb animation counter
#   limb_speed - limb movement speed
#   age - age in ticks
#   head_yaw - head yaw
#   head_pitch - head pitch
#   scale - render scale, default is 0.0625
#
# Operators
#   +, -, *, /
#
# Functions
#   sin(x)
#   cos(x)
#   tan(x)
#   atan(x)
#   atan2(y,x)
#   torad(deg)
#   todeg(rad)
#   min(x,y)
#   max(x,y)
#   clamp(x,xmin,xmax)
#   abs(x)
#   floor(x)
#   ceil(x)
#   frac(x)
#   round(x)
#   sqrt(x)
#
#  Example:
#    ...
#    "animations":
#    [
#      {
#        "this.rx": "clamp(-0.5 * part.rx, 0, 90)",
#        "this.tx": "3 * sin(limb_swing / 4) - 2",
#        "this:Hoof.rx": "leg4:Hoof.rx / 2"
#        ...
#      }
#    ]
