HD Fonts
========

As of 1.6, Minecraft allows fonts to be higher resolution than the default, but customization is still limited.

OptiFine first looks for fonts in the "assets/minecraft/optifine/font" folder. 
This allows you to have a custom font that works in vanilla and a higher resolution font that requires OptiFine to display properly.

    Default font: assets/minecraft/optifine/font/ascii.png
    Enchanting table font: assets/minecraft/optifine/font/ascii_sga.png

Note: Unicode fonts are not supported.

To allow for more control over the widths of individual characters, OptiFine offers a way to specify them manually. 
Create a properties file called:

    assets/minecraft/optifine/font/ascii.properties
    assets/minecraft/optifine/font/ascii_sga.properties

corresponding to the font you wish to customize.

Properties file format
======================

Each line in this file specifies the width of a character:

  # Custom width
  width.<ascii value 0-255>=<width 0-8>

For example, to specify the widths of capital A, B, and C, you might use

  # ABC
  width.65=5.9
  width.66=5
  width.67=5.25

Values can be floating point numbers (Vanilla only supports integer widths) and range from 0-8 regardless of the resolution of the font. 
You do not need to specify widths for all characters, only the ones where you want to override the default width.

The space character default width is 4.0. 
You can override this the same way, by setting "width.32" to a custom value.

Alpha Blending
==============

When enabled the font will use alpha blending

  # Alpha blending
  blend=<true|false>

Bold offset
===========

Bold characters are rendered twice with a small X offset which corresponds to the character stroke width. 
The default offset is 1.0 for standard 8x fonts (texture 128x128) and 0.5 for higher resolutions.

  # Bold offset
  offsetBold=<value>
