# Enable or disable old hand light 
# Backwards compatibility for shader packs not supporting main and off hand.
# When enabled uses the handheld item with higher light value for the main hand.

# Shader options are parsed from the ".fsh" and ".vsh" files located in the folder "shaders"
# The line comment located after the option is shown as a tooltip
# Tooltip lines are split on sentence end ". "
# Tooltip lines ending with "!" are automatically shown red.
# One option can be present in several shader files and it will be switched simultaneously in all of them
# Ambiguous options (different default values found) are disabled and can not be changed
# Right click on a shader option resets it to default

# Profiles allow a set of options to be switched together
# The current profile is detected based on the selected option values
# If no profile matches the current option values, the profile "Custom" is selected
# It is recommended that all profiles use the same list of options and only the values differ
# Disabled programs are special options and only disabling (prefix !) is recognized for them

# Profile options
#   OPTION:value  - set value
#   OPTION=value  - set value
#   OPTION        - set boolean option ON
#   !OPTION       - set boolean option OFF
#   profile.NAME  - copy all options from another profile
#   !program.name - disable program "name". The program name may include dimension: "world-1/gbuffers_water"
#
# The following program names are recognized:

# Option screen configuration
# Main screen
screen=<list of options>
# Sub-screen
screen.NAME=<list of options>

# Screen options
#   OPTION    - option name
#   [NAME]    - link to sub-screen NAME
#   <profile> - profile selection
#   <empty>   - empty slot
#   *         - the rest of the options not configured on any of the screens
# The options are shown in two columns:
#   1  2
#   3  4
#   5  6
#   ...
# When more than 18 options are present the screen switches to 3 or more columns.
# The option names are automatically shortened to avoid text overflow outside the button.
#
# Example:
# screen=<profile> <empty> BLOOM CELLSHADING [SUN_EFFECTS] [WAVING_GRASS]
# screen.SUN_EFFECTS=SUN_EFFECTS GOD_RAYS LENS_FLARE RAINDROPS
# screen.WAVING_GRASS=WAVING_GRASS WAVING_LEAVES WAVING_VINES
# screen.MISC=*
#
# User friendly screen labels can be loaded from language files in "/shaders/lang"
# Example from "/shaders/lang/en_US.lang"
# screen.DOF=Depth of field
# screen.DOF.comment=Depth of field effect. Adds blur to out of focus objects.
# screen.WAVING=Waving grass and leaves
# screen.WAVING.comment=Waving grass, leaves, fire and entities

# Shaders can be separated by world dimension by placing them in folder "/shaders/world<id>" where "id" is the world dimension.
# When the world folder is present the shaders will be loaded only from there ignoring the default folder.
# Creating an empty world folder effectively disables the shaders for this world dimension.
# Mod world dimensions should also work.
# Only ".vsh" and ".fsh" files are loaded from the dimension folder.
# Example
#   /shaders         - default shaders
#   /shaders/world-1 - nether shaders
#   /shaders/world1  - end shaders
#
# Dimension folders are also scanned for options.
# The options in dimension foldes may be given different names to avoid conflict with default values.

# The "#include" directive found in ".vsh" and ".fsh" files is replaced with the contents of the included file
# Relative, look in same folder
#   #include "const.inc"
# Absolute, start from base folder "/shaders"
#   #include "/world-55/lib.inc"
# 
# Included files may include other files.
# The maximum include depth is limited to 10.
#
# To avoid code duplication on nested includes the following can be used:
#   // File A
#   #ifndef INCLUDE_A
#   #define INCLUDE_A
#   ... <code>
#   #endif
