# OptiFine version
# The minimum OptiFine version which is required by the shader pack
# Each Minecraft version has to be specified separately.
# For example:
#   version.1.12.2=D1
#   version.1.10.2=F1
#   version.1.8=J1
version.<mc_ver>=<of_edition>

# Custom textures
# Allows custom textures to be bound to the available shader units.
# Format:
#  texture.<stage>.<name>=<path>
# Stage:
#  gbuffers - gbuffers and shadow programs
#  deferred - deferred programs
#  composite - composite and final programs
# Name is the texture unit name, see "shaders.txt" for the available names.
# The textures can be loaded from different places:
# 1. Shader pack 
#   The texture path is relative to the folder "shaders".
#   Example:
#     texture.composite.colortex1=textures/noise.png
# 2. Resource pack
#   The texture path should start with "minecraft:"
#   Example
#     texture.composite.colortex2=minecraft:textures/font/ascii.png
# 3. Dynamic (lightmap, texture atlas)
#   Example
#     texture.composite.colortex3=minecraft:dynamic/lightmap_1
#     texture.composite.colortex4=minecraft:textures/atlas/blocks.png
# The suffix "_n" and "_s" can be used to load the normal/specular variant of the texture,
# for example "minecraft:textures/atlas/blocks_n.png"
# 
# Raw textures (binary dump) can also be loaded:
#   texture.<stage>.<name>=<path> <type> <internalFormat> <dimensions> <pixelFormat> <pixelType>
# Where:
#   <type> is one of: TEXTURE_1D, TEXTURE_2D, TEXTURE_3D, TEXTURE_RECTANGLE
#   <internalFormat> is the texture format, see Texture Formats in "shaders.txt" for the available names
#   <dimensions> is a list of texture dimensions, depends on the texture type
#   <pixelFormat> is the pixel format, see Pixel Formats in "shaders.txt" for the available names
#   <pixelType> is the pixel type, see Pixel Types in "shaders.txt" for the available names
# For example: 
#   texture.composite.gaux1=textures/lut_1d.dat TEXTURE_1D RGBA32F 256 RGBA FLOAT
#   texture.composite.gaux1.2=textures/lut_3d.dat TEXTURE_3D RGBA32F 64 64 64 RGBA FLOAT
# It is possible to bind several textures with different types to one texture unit.
# The shaders can differentiate between them based on the sampler type: sampler1d, sampler2d, sampler3d ...
# In one program only one sampler type can be used per texture unit.
# The suffixes ".0" to ".9" can be added to <name> to avoid duplicate property keys.
# Wrap and filter modes can be configured by adding standard texture ".mcmeta" files, 
# for example: "textures/lut_3d.dat.mcmeta"
texture.<stage>.<name>=<path>

# Custom noise texture
# Allows the noise texture to be loaded from the shader pack
texture.noise=<path>

# Shader options are parsed from the ".fsh" and ".vsh" files located in the folder "shaders".
# The line comment located after the option is shown as a tooltip.
# Tooltip lines are split on sentence end ". ".
# Tooltip lines ending with "!" are automatically shown red.
# One option can be present in several shader files and it will be switched simultaneously in all of them.
# Ambiguous options (different default values found) are disabled and can not be changed.
# Left click on an option button selects the next value, right click selects the previous value and 
# Shift + click resets the option to default value.
#
# Boolean, default ON
#   #define SSAO       // Screen space ambient occlusion. High performance impact.
# Boolean, default OFF
#   // #define SSAO    // Screen space ambient occlusion. High performance impact.
#
# The boolean variables are recognized only if the matching "#ifdef" or "#ifndef" is also found in the same file. 
#
# Variable
#   #define SHADOW_DARKNESS 0.10   // Shadow darkness levels [0.05 0.10 0.20]
#
# The allowed values are given as a list "[v1 v2 v3]" in the comment.
# The default value is automatically added if not present in the list.
#
# Some "const" variables are also recognized (backwards compatibility with the Shaders Mod).
# They use a structure similar to the macro variables, for example: 
#   const int shadowMapResolution = 1572; // Shadowmap resolution [1024 1572 2048]
#   const float shadowDistance = 64.0;    // Draw distance of shadows [32.0 64.0 128.0 256.0]
#
# Const variables without allowed values are by default not visible, unless used in a profile or configured on a screen.
#
# The recognized "const" variables are:
#   shadowMapResolution
#   shadowDistance
#   shadowDistanceRenderMul
#   shadowIntervalSize
#   generateShadowMipmap
#   generateShadowColorMipmap
#   shadowHardwareFiltering

# Alpha test

# Where 
#  - func is one of: NEVER, LESS, EQUAL, LEQUAL, GREATER, NOTEQUAL, GEQUAL, GL_ALWAYS
#  - ref - float value
alphaTest.<program>=<off|func ref>

# Blend mode
# The blend mode can be configured per program.
# Where src, dst, srcA and dstA are one of: ZERO, ONE, SRC_COLOR, ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR, DST_COLOR, ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR, 
# SRC_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, DST_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA, SRC_ALPHA_SATURATE
blend.<program>=<off|src dst srcA dstA>

# Blend mode per buffer
# The blend mode can be configured per program and buffer
# Where src, dst, srcA and dstA are one of: ZERO, ONE, SRC_COLOR, ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR, DST_COLOR, ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR, 
# SRC_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, DST_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA, SRC_ALPHA_SATURATE

# Composite render scale
# Defines a custom viewport to be used when rendering composite and deferred programs.
# The scale, offsetX and offsetY should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
scale.<program>=<scale|scale offsetX ofsetY>

# Ping-pong buffer flip
# Enable or disable ping-pong buffer flip for a specific buffer name in a specific composite or deferred program.
# When buffer flip is disabled the next composite program will use the same input and output buffers for this buffer name.
# The last program that writes to the buffer should have flip enabled so that the following programs can read from the buffer.
# This can be used with composite render scale to allow several composite programs to write to different regions in the same buffer.
# Forced buffer flip can be used to read from both ping-pong buffers.
flip.<program>.<buffer>=<true|false>

# Buffer size
# Define custom fixed size for a specific buffer.
# Only prepare, deferred and composite programs can render to fixed size buffers.
# Rendering to fixed size and normal buffers at the same time is not possible.
# When rendering to several fixed size buffers all of them must have the same size.
# When width and height are floating point values, then the buffer size will be relative to the render size.
# For example "size.buffer.colortex2=0.5 0.5" will create the buffer with widht and height half of the render width and height.
size.buffer.<buffer>=width height

# Enable or disable programs depending on shader options
# Disabled progams are processed as not defined and instead their fallback programs will be used.
# The program name can contain dimension folder, for example:
#   program.world-1/composite2.enabled=BLOOM
# The expression is a boolean expression which can use shader options of type switch (on/off), for example:
#   program.composite.enabled=(BLOOM || SSAO) && !GODRAYS
program.<program>.enabled=<expression>

# Shaders can be separated by world dimension by placing them in folder "/shaders/world<id>" where "id" is the world dimension.
# When the world folder is present the shaders will be loaded only from there ignoring the default folder.
# Creating an empty world folder effectively disables the shaders for this world dimension.
# Mod world dimensions should also work.
# Only ".vsh" and ".fsh" files are loaded from the dimension folder.
# Example
#   /shaders         - default shaders
#   /shaders/world-1 - nether shaders
#   /shaders/world1  - end shaders
#
# Dimension folders are also scanned for options.
# The options in dimension foldes may be given different names to avoid conflict with default values.

# The "#include" directive found in ".vsh" and ".fsh" files is replaced with the contents of the included file
# Relative, look in same folder
#   #include "const.inc"
# Absolute, start from base folder "/shaders"
#   #include "/world-55/lib.inc"
# 
# Included files may include other files.
# The maximum include depth is limited to 10.
#
# To avoid code duplication on nested includes the following can be used:
#   // File A
#   #ifndef INCLUDE_A
#   #define INCLUDE_A
#   ... <code>
#   #endif
# 
# When Minecraft is started with argument "-Dshaders.debug.save=true" then the final shaders will be saved in "shaderpacks/debug".
