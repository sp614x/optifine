# Custom textures
# Allows custom textures to be loaded from the shader pack and to be bound to the available shader units.
# Format:
#  texture.<stage>.<name>=<path>
# Stage:
#  gbuffers - gbuffers and shadow programs
#  composite - composite and final programs
# Name is the texture unit name, see "shaders.txt" for the available names. 
# The texture path is relative to the folder "shaders".
# Example:
#  texture.composite.colortex5=textures/glass.png
texture.<stage>.<name>=<path>

# Shader options are parsed from the ".fsh" and ".vsh" files located in the folder "shaders".
# The line comment located after the option is shown as a tooltip.
# Tooltip lines are split on sentence end ". ".
# Tooltip lines ending with "!" are automatically shown red.
# One option can be present in several shader files and it will be switched simultaneously in all of them.
# Ambiguous options (different default values found) are disabled and can not be changed.
# Left click on an option button selects the next value, right click selects the previous value and 
# Shift + click resets the option to default value.
#
# Boolean, default ON
#   #define SSAO       // Screen space ambient occlusion. High performance impact.
# Boolean, default OFF
#   // #define SSAO    // Screen space ambient occlusion. High performance impact.
#
# The boolean variables are recognized only if the matching "#ifdef" or "#ifndef" is also found in the same file. 
#
# Variable
#   #define SHADOW_DARKNESS 0.10   // Shadow darkness levels [0.05 0.10 0.20]
#
# The allowed values are given as a list "[v1 v2 v3]" in the comment.
# The default value is automatically added if not present in the list.
#
# Some "const" variables are also recognized (backwards compatibility with the Shaders Mod).
# They use a structure similar to the macro variables, for example: 
#   const int shadowMapResolution = 1572; // Shadowmap resolution [1024 1572 2048]
#   const float shadowDistance = 64.0;    // Draw distance of shadows [32.0 64.0 128.0 256.0]
#
# Const variables without allowed values are by default not visible, unless used in a profile or configured on a screen.
#
# The recognized "const" variables are:
#   shadowMapResolution
#   shadowDistance
#   shadowDistanceRenderMul
#   shadowIntervalSize
#   generateShadowMipmap
#   generateShadowColorMipmap

# Profiles allow a set of options to be switched together
# The current profile is detected based on the selected option values
# If no profile matches the current option values, the profile "Custom" is selected
# It is recommended that all profiles use the same list of options and only the values differ
# Disabled programs are special options and only disabling (prefix !) is recognized for them

#   profile.NAME  - copy all options from another profile
#   !program.name - disable program "name". The program name may include dimension: "world-1/gbuffers_water"

# Option screen configuration
# Main screen
screen=<list of options>
# Sub-screen
screen.NAME=<list of options>

# Screen options
#   OPTION    - option name
#   [NAME]    - link to sub-screen NAME
#   <profile> - profile selection
#   <empty>   - empty slot
#   *         - the rest of the options not configured on any of the screens

# Option columns per screen
# By default the options are shown in two columns:
#   1  2
#   3  4
#   5  6
#   ...
# When more than 18 options are present the screen switches to 3 or more columns.
# The option names are automatically shortened to avoid text overflow outside the button.
#
# Main screen
screen.columns=2
# Sub-screen
screen.NAME.columns=2

# Example:
# screen=<profile> <empty> BLOOM CELLSHADING [SUN_EFFECTS] [WAVING_GRASS]
# screen.SUN_EFFECTS=SUN_EFFECTS GOD_RAYS LENS_FLARE RAINDROPS
# screen.WAVING_GRASS=WAVING_GRASS WAVING_LEAVES WAVING_VINES
# screen.MISC=*
#
# User friendly screen labels can be loaded from language files in "/shaders/lang"
# Example from "/shaders/lang/en_US.lang"
# screen.DOF=Depth of field
# screen.DOF.comment=Depth of field effect. Adds blur to out of focus objects.
# screen.WAVING=Waving grass and leaves
# screen.WAVING.comment=Waving grass, leaves, fire and entities

# Shaders can be separated by world dimension by placing them in folder "/shaders/world<id>" where "id" is the world dimension.
# When the world folder is present the shaders will be loaded only from there ignoring the default folder.
# Creating an empty world folder effectively disables the shaders for this world dimension.
# Mod world dimensions should also work.
# Only ".vsh" and ".fsh" files are loaded from the dimension folder.
# Example
#   /shaders         - default shaders
#   /shaders/world-1 - nether shaders
#   /shaders/world1  - end shaders
#
# Dimension folders are also scanned for options.
# The options in dimension foldes may be given different names to avoid conflict with default values.

# The "#include" directive found in ".vsh" and ".fsh" files is replaced with the contents of the included file
# Relative, look in same folder
#   #include "const.inc"
# Absolute, start from base folder "/shaders"
#   #include "/world-55/lib.inc"
# 
# Included files may include other files.
# The maximum include depth is limited to 10.
#
# To avoid code duplication on nested includes the following can be used:
#   // File A
#   #ifndef INCLUDE_A
#   #define INCLUDE_A
#   ... <code>
#   #endif
# 
# When Minecraft is started with argument "-Dshaders.debug.save=true" then the final shaders will be saved in "shaderpacks/debug".
