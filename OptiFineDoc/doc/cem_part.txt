# Json Part Model
# Reference configuration for OptiFine's feature Custom Entity Models
######################################################################
# This file contains the definition of one model part and it can be
# referenced as "model" from the entity model.
# The file extension ".jpm" is recommended, but not required.
# It should be located in the "assets/minecraft/optifine/cem" folder of your resource pack.
#
# Texture UV can be specified in box format with "textureOffset" or 
# individually with "uvDown", "uvUp", "uvNorth", "uvSouth", "uvWest" and "uvEast".
# Either the box format or the individual face UV should be used, they can not be mixed.
# The box format UV mapping is shown in "model_box.png".
#
# Textures can be specified as:
#   "texture" - (no '/' in name), look in current folder
#   "./folder/texture" - relative to current folder
#   "~/folder/texture" - relative to folder "assets/minecraft/optifine/"
#   "folder/texture" - relative to folder "assets/minecraft/"
#   "mod:folder/texture - resolves as "assets/mod/folder/texture.png"
# 
# The texture suffix ".png" is optional.
#
# Required elements:
# - "textureOffset" or individual face UV
# - "coordinates" 
#
# Entities can have items/blocks attached to them. The attachments system allows you to render these items/blocks attached to model parts of your choice.
# 
# Attachment name          Supported models
