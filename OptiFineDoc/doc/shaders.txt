Overview
========
The Shaders Mod makes use of a deferred rendering pipeline. 
The gbuffer shaders come first in the pipeline. They render data to textures that will be sent to the composite shaders. 
The composite shaders then render to textures that will be sent to the final shader. 
The final shader renders directly to the screen.

Color Attachments
=================
The data is passed from shader to shader using color attachments. 
There are at least 4 for all machines. For machines that can support it, there are 8. 
In the composite and final shaders, these are referenced by the gcolor, gdepth, gnormal, composite, gaux1, gaux2, gaux3 and gaux4 uniforms
(colortex0 to colortex7 can be used instead of gcolor, gdepth etc.)
Despite the naming, all of these color attachments are the same and can be used for any purpose with the exception of the first two. 
The first one, gcolor has its color cleared to the current fog color before rendering. 
The second one, gdepth has its color cleared to solid white before rendering and uses a higher precision storage buffer suitable for storing depth values. 
The rest have their color cleared to black with 0 alpha.

When writing to the color attachments in the composite shader, blending is disabled. 
Writing to color attachments that the composite shader also reads from will generate artifacts (unless you just copy the original contents) 

The current shaderpack can be reloaded by pressing "F3+R"

Bugs:
 - Programs gbuffers_terrain_solid, cutout and cutout_mip are not used

Todo:
 - Separate programs for world border, entities (by id, by type), cape, elytra, wolf collar, etc. 
 - Activate gbuffers_beaconbeam

Block ID mapping
================
The block ID mapping is defined in "shaders/block.properties" included in the shader pack.
Format "block.<id>=<block1> <block2> ..."
The key is the substitute block ID, the value are the blocks which are to be replaced.
Only one line per block ID is allowed.
See "properties_files.txt" for the block matching rules.

  # Short format
  block.31=red_flower yellow_flower reeds
  # Long format
  block.31=minecraft:red_flower ic2:nether_flower botania:reeds
  # Properties
  block.31=minecraft:red_flower:type=white_tulip minecraft:red_flower:type=pink_tulip botania:reeds:type=green
  # Block ID, Metadata (backwards compatibility)

Depth buffers
=============

depthtex0   everything
depthtex1   no translucent objects (water, stained glass) 
depthtex2   no translucent objects (water, stained glass), no handheld objects

Standard Macros
===============
The standard macros are automatically included after the "#version" declaration in every shader file

A. Minecraft version
 #define MC_VERSION <value>
 The value is in format 122 (major 1, minor 2, release 2)
 For example: 1.9.4 -> 10904, 1.11.2 -> 11102, etc.

B. Maximum supported GL version
 #define MC_GL_VERSION <value>
 The value is integer, for example: 210, 320, 450

C. Maximum supported GLSL version
 #define MC_GLSL_VERSION <value>
 The value is integer, for example: 120, 150, 450

D. Operating system 
 One of the following:
  #define MC_OS_WINDOWS
  #define MC_OS_MAC
  #define MC_OS_LINUX
  #define MC_OS_OTHER

E. GPU
 One of the following:
  #define MC_GL_VENDOR_ATI
  #define MC_GL_VENDOR_INTEL
  #define MC_GL_VENDOR_NVIDIA
  #define MC_GL_VENDOR_XORG
  #define MC_GL_VENDOR_OTHER

F. Driver
 One of the following:
  #define MC_GL_RENDERER_RADEON 
  #define MC_GL_RENDERER_GEFORCE
  #define MC_GL_RENDERER_QUADRO
  #define MC_GL_RENDERER_INTEL
  #define MC_GL_RENDERER_GALLIUM
  #define MC_GL_RENDERER_MESA
  #define MC_GL_RENDERER_OTHER

G. OpenGL extensions
 Macros for the supported OpenGL extensions are named like the corresponding extension with a prefix "MC_".
 For example the macro "MC_GL_ARB_shader_texture_lod" is defined when the extension "GL_ARB_shader_texture_lod" is supported.
 Only the macros which are referenced and supported are added to the shader file.
