Overview
========
The Shaders Mod makes use of a deferred rendering pipeline.
The gbuffer shaders come first in the pipeline. They render data to textures that will be sent to the composite shaders. 
Optional composite shaders can be added after the shadow map (shadowcomp), before terrain (prepare) and before water rendering (deferred).
The composite shaders then render to textures that will be sent to the final shader. 
The final shader renders directly to the screen.

Shader Files
============
All shader files are placed in the folder "shaders" of the shader pack.
The shader source files use the name of the program in which they are to be used with extension depending on their type.

Extension  Type                 
==========================
.csh       Compute shader
.vsh       Vertex shader     
.gsh       Geometry shader   
.fsh       Fragment shader   

Geometry shaders need either OpenGL 3.2 with layout qualifiers or the extension GL_ARB_geometry_shader4 (GL_EXT_geometry_shader4) 
with configuration "maxVerticesOut".

Color Attachments
=================
The data is passed from shader to shader using color attachments. 
There are at least 4 for all machines. For machines that can support it, there are up to 16.
MacOS is limited to 8 color attachments, even with modern GPUs.
In the deferred, composite and final shaders, these are referenced by the gcolor, gdepth, gnormal, composite, gaux1, gaux2, gaux3 and gaux4 uniforms.
(colortex0 to colortex15 can be used instead of gcolor, gdepth etc.)
Despite the naming, all of these color attachments are the same and can be used for any purpose with the exception of the first two. 
The first one, gcolor has its color cleared to the current fog color before rendering. 
The second one, gdepth has its color cleared to solid white before rendering and uses a higher precision storage buffer suitable for storing depth values. 
The rest have their color cleared to black with 0 alpha.

Each color attachment uses 2 buffers (A and B) with logical names "main" and "alt", which can be used as ping-pong buffers.
When the buffers are flipped the mapping between main/alt and A/B is reversed.
Gbuffer programs always read from "main" (only gaux1-4) and write to "main" buffers (they shouldn't read and write to the same buffer at the same time).
Deferred/composite programs always read from "main" and write to "alt" buffers. 
After a deferred/composite program is rendered the buffers that it writes to are flipped so the next programs can see the current output as input.
The property "flip.<program>.<buffer>=<true|false>" can be used to enable or disable the flip independant of the buffer write.
The virtual programs "deferred_pre" and "composite_pre" can be used for buffer flipping before the deferred/composite pass.

Output color attachments are configured with the "/* DRAWBUFFERS:XYZ */" or "/* RENDERTARGETS: X,Y,Z */" comment, placed in the fragment shader.
Gbuffers, deferred and composite programs can write to any color attachment, but no more than 8 at the same time.
If the output color attachments are not configured, then the program will write to the first 8 color attachments.  

In shaders using the modern syntax (130 and above) the outputs of the fragment shader should use the outColor<n> names. Example:
/* DRAWBUFFERS:3,4,7 */
out vec4 outColor0; // Writes to buffer 3
out vec4 outColor1; // Writes to buffer 4
out vec4 outColor2; // Writes to buffer 7

When writing to the color attachments in the composite shader, blending is disabled. 
Writing to color attachments that the composite shader also reads from will generate artifacts (unless you just copy the original contents) 

The shaders configuration parsing is affected by the preprocessor conditional compilation directives.
The following preprocessor directives are currently recognized:
  #define <macro>
  #undef <macro>
  #ifdef <macro>
  #ifndef <macro>
  #if <int>
  #if defined <macro>
  #if !defined <macro>
  #elif <int>
  #elif defined <macro> 
  #elif !defined <macro>
  #else
  #endif

The current shaderpack can be reloaded by pressing "F3+R" or using the command "/reloadShaders". 

Compute Shaders
===============
A list of compute shaders can be attached to every program except gbuffers programs.
They are named like the program with optional suffix, for example "composite.csh", "composite_a.csh" ... "composite_z.csh".
Compute shaders run before the program and can read from all buffers using texture samplers.
They can read and write to colortex0-5 and shadowcolor0-1 buffers as images using the aliases colorimg0-5 and shadowcolorimg0-1, 
for example "layout (rgba8) uniform image2D colorimg0;"
Compute shaders need at least "#version 430" and local size definition, for example: "layout (local_size_x = 16, local_size_y = 16) in;".
Work groups are defined either fixed via "const ivec3 workGroups = ivec3(50, 30, 1);" or relative to render size 
via "const vec2 workGroupsRender = vec2(0.5f, 0.5f);".
The default configuration is "const vec2 workGroupsRender = vec2(1.0f, 1.0f);", which executes the compute shader once per pixel.

Image access
============
All programs can read and write to colorimg0-5 and shadowcolorimg0-1 using imageLoad() and imageStore().

Block ID mapping
================
The block ID mapping is defined in "shaders/block.properties" included in the shader pack.
Forge mods may add custom block mapping as "assets/<modid>/shaders/block.properties" in the mod JAR file.
The "block.properties" file can use conditional preprocessor directives (#ifdef, #if, etc.)
For more details see section "Standard Macros" A to I. Option macros are also available.
Format "block.<id>=<block1> <block2> ..."
The key is the substitute block ID, the values are the blocks which are to be replaced.
Only one line per block ID is allowed.
See "properties_files.txt" for the block matching rules.

  # Short format
  block.31=red_flower yellow_flower reeds
  # Long format
  block.32=minecraft:red_flower ic2:nether_flower botania:reeds
  # Properties
  block.33=minecraft:red_flower:type=white_tulip minecraft:red_flower:type=pink_tulip botania:reeds:type=green

See "properties.files" for more details.

Block render layers
===================
The custom block render layers are defined in "shaders/block.properties" included in the shader pack.

  layer.solid=<blocks>
  layer.cutout=<blocks>
  layer.cutout_mipped=<blocks>
  layer.translucent=<blocks>

Layers
  solid - no alpha, no blending (solid textures)
  cutout - alpha, no blending (cutout textures)
  cutout_mipped - alpha, no blending, mipmaps (cutout with mipmaps)
  translucent - alpha, blending, mipmaps (water, stained glass)
 
Blocks which are solid opaque cubes (stone, dirt, ores, etc) can't be rendered on a custom layer
as this would affect face culling, ambient occlusion, light propagation and so on.

For exaple:
  layer.translucent=glass_pane fence wooden_door

Item ID mapping
================
The item ID mapping is defined in "shaders/item.properties" included in the shader pack.
Forge mods may add custom item mapping as "assets/<modid>/shaders/item.properties" in the mod JAR file.
The "item.properties" file can use conditional preprocessor directives (#ifdef, #if, etc.)
For more details see section "Standard Macros" A to I. Option macros are also available.
Format "item.<id>=<item1> <item2> ..."
The key is the substitute item ID, the values are the items which are to be replaced.
Only one line per item ID is allowed.

  # Short format
  item.5000=diamond_sword dirt
  # Long format
  item.5001=minecraft:diamond_sword botania:reeds

Entity ID mapping
=================
The entity ID mapping is defined in "shaders/entity.properties" included in the shader pack.
Forge mods may add custom entity mapping as "assets/<modid>/shaders/entity.properties" in the mod JAR file.
The "entity.properties" file can use conditional preprocessor directives (#ifdef, #if, etc.)
For more details see section "Standard Macros" A to I. Option macros are also available.
Format "entity.<id>=<entity1> <entity2> ..."
The key is the substitute entity ID, the values are the entities which are to be replaced.
Only one line per entity ID is allowed.

  # Short format
  entity.2000=sheep cow
  # Long format
  entity.2001=minecraft:pig botania:pixie

Standard Macros
===============
The standard macros are automatically included after the "#version" declaration in every shader file

A. Minecraft version
 #define MC_VERSION <value>
 The value is in format 122 (major 1, minor 2, release 2)
 For example: 1.9.4 -> 10904, 1.11.2 -> 11102, etc.

B. Maximum supported GL version
 #define MC_GL_VERSION <value>
 The value is integer, for example: 210, 320, 450

C. Maximum supported GLSL version
 #define MC_GLSL_VERSION <value>
 The value is integer, for example: 120, 150, 450

D. Operating system 
 One of the following:
  #define MC_OS_WINDOWS
  #define MC_OS_MAC
  #define MC_OS_LINUX
  #define MC_OS_OTHER

E. Driver
 One of the following:
  #define MC_GL_VENDOR_AMD
  #define MC_GL_VENDOR_ATI
  #define MC_GL_VENDOR_INTEL
  #define MC_GL_VENDOR_MESA

G. OpenGL extensions
 Macros for the supported OpenGL extensions are named like the corresponding extension with a prefix "MC_".
 For example the macro "MC_GL_ARB_shader_texture_lod" is defined when the extension "GL_ARB_shader_texture_lod" is supported.
 Only the macros which are referenced and supported are added to the shader file.
